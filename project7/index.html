                        This is the main service we ought to provide to our user. If you are new to a town and want to
                        rent a place and if you ask a wrong person they will direct you to a place so expensive you cant
                        afford and then you will you will waste money in that place or will waste money finding a new
                        one. But here at space rentals we provide you an online platform that will show you hostels and
                        pgs near you that have considerate rates and better quality. You can book it from our platform
                        to get an extra discount.

                        Now that you have aqcuired a living place, its not like you came to this city just to be in a
                        room. You obviously will need to travel to places and that requires transportation but being in
                        new city you dont have vehicles of your owm and renting a cab is way too expensive on a daily
                        basis. Even using
                        buses can be frustating. So we here provide transportation facilities for our customers at a
                        very considerate prices not charging anything above the money spent in transportation.
                        It is a very good deal. well ofcourse this transportation is optional but if you need we are
                        just a click away.

                        this? Where to start from and most importantly will it work? But with all the blessings it
                        worked thankyou all for supporting

                        This idea came to me to start a hostel and pgs renting community. As we were hostelites and i
                        saw the conditions there. it wasnt good. they overcharged everything and the service wasnt theat
                        good. So I gave this idea to my frds and we all started working on this project.

                        they told me aout their idea I was impressed by the idea and wanted to help them in anyway
                        possible. Hence we all worked hard to get this up and running.
